#Android Freemium Library sample project
This project is a sample project to show how the library works.
Without being uploaded, having a real premium package, public key, and ad Id, the project isn't really functionnal
but shows at least the way you have to implement it.

See the library's [Readme.md](https://github.com/MagicMicky/FreemiumLibrary) for more information
